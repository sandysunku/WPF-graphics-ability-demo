It showcases the power of WPF with concern to graphics

WPF uses vector graphics as its rendering data format. Vector graphics—which include Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Windows metafiles (.wmf), and TrueType fonts—store rendering data and transmit it as a list of instructions that describe how to recreate an image using graphics primitives.

## How are graphics prepared
All the graphics shown in the application are developed using Microsoft expression studio. But the software is no more supported by Microsoft hence the download is not available now. But you can use any tool where you can get xaml dump.
